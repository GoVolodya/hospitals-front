This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First make sure you have installed Node.js version >= v18.17.0 (follow instruction from here https://nodejs.org/en)

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Before committing any changes use (for linting and prettier):

```bash
npm run lint
#and
npm run format
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Follow instructions from terminal if port 3000 is already taken.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)
to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
